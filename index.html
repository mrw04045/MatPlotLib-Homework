  <p>Pymaceuticals Inc. specializes in drug-based, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals.</p>
  <p>In their most recent efforts, they've since begun screening for potential treatments to 
    squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.</p>
  <p>The objective in this project was to analyze the data to show how
